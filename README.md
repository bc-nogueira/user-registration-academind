# User Registration Project

This is a basic project made with React for studying purposes. It's used to register users, validating attributes presence and age value before registration. The data is not persisted so it will reload every time the page is refreshed.

I coded along during the course [React - The Complete Guide (incl Hooks, React Router, Redux)](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/#instructor-2) by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller at Udemy.

## My changes

Everything included in the first commit is from the original project. All later commits are changes that I made to the project. These changes include:
